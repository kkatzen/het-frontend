      <h1>OUR INITIATIVE.</h1>
      We aim to create a collaborative, multidisciplinary, multisector,
      public-facing data platform devoted to addressing the health equity
      implications for vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and
      develop standardized, evidence-based, best practices for developing
      socio-culturally responsive guidelines, resources, toolkits, and
      evaluation metrics for mitigating COVID-19 disparate outcomes for
      vulnerable populations and to provide technical assistance to health
      organizations, including state and local jurisdictions’ COVID-19
      responses.
      <h1>OUR PROJECT.</h1>
      Examining the political determinants of health by creating a
      comprehensive, interactive, public-facing COVID-19 Health Equity Map of
      the United States and its territories, inclusive of all racial population
      groups. This project analyzes jurisdictional policies that either
      exacerbate or alleviate COVID-19 outcomes, comorbidities, resource
      allocation/management, jurisdictions’ response, and mitigation strategies,
      testing, and contact tracing, and overall implications for health equity
      for vulnerable populations. The project allows us to not only understand
      and share policy research on racial and ethnic and socioeconomic
      disparities but to understand and share information on the
      mental/behavioral health equity impact of COVID-19.
      <h1>OUR IMPACT.</h1>
      Benchmarking equity to create actionable evidence-based policy responses
      by engaging with diverse communities across the country to develop policy
      templates for local, state, and federal policymakers, and develop and
      publish a state-by-state report card or county-by-county report card based
      on five to ten objectives/thresholds determined by a national panel of
      experts under our COVID-19 Health Equity Commission (CHEC). The project
      creates a special track in HELEN focused on coordinating COVID-19
      community engagement, education, training, information exchange and
      dissemination, policy analysis, and advocacy.
